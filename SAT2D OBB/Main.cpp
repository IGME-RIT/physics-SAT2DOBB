Description:
This is a Separating Axis Theorem test. (Sometimes just called Separating Axis Test.) This is in 2D.
Contains two squares, one that is stationary and one that is moving. They are bounded by OBBs
(Object-Oriented Bounding Boxes) and when these OBBs collide the moving object "bounces" on the
x axis (because that is the only direction the object is moving). The algorithm will detect any
axis of collision, but will not output the axis that was collided (because it doesn't know). Thus,
we assume x and hardcode in the x axis bounce.
There is a physics timestep such that every update runs at the same delta time, regardless of how fast
or slow the computer is running. The squares should be the exact same as their OBBs, since they are
aligned on the same axis.
